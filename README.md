# agricultural commodity price prediction using machine learning
Agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy of many countries, our project is to basically make the job of the farmers, traders and policymakers easier by helping them in making informed decisions by developing a machine learning model for predicting the agricultural commodity prices which helps the stakeholder and farmers in making better decisions regarding planting ,harvesting and trading.

The agricultural commodities are mainly dependent on the weather patterns, government policies, supply and demand dynamics, seasonal patterns and geopolitical events , a machine learning model is capable of predicting agricultural commodity based on the historical and relevant features and provides insights into market trends and price fluctuations in agricultural products.

The data collection for the model is done by gathering the data from sources such as government databases, commodity exchanges and agricultural research institutions, different algorithms such as Moving average, linear regression, KNN, Auto ARIMA, and LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)  are used to find the best performing model and also to get the accurate prediction according to the features.

The programming language used in the model is python , the libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Tensor Flow/Pytorch 
Data visualization is done using Matplotlib, seaborn and the database used are SQLite/MySQL and the application/web development is using the react.js /html,css,js
